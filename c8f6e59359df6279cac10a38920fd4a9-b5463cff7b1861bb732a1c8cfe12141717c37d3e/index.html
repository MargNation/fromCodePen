			<p>Jojo Mayer is a Swiss drummer who has taken the world by storm for his ability to meld together the sounds of jazz with drum and bass. He is the leader of the electronica group Nerve, which was founded in 1997.
			<br><br>In 2001, I had the great fortune of attending a clinic of his in Atlanta, GA, and I've never forgotten it. At that time, his main focus was reproducing synthesized, electronic sounds on his own drum kit. The videos below show that he is able to accomplish that task.
			<br><br>Here are some cool facts about Jojo:
			<ul>
				<li style="color: #5879ad"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px"><em>He is completely self-taught.</em></span></li>
				<li style="color: #5879ad"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px"><em>He received his first drum set at the age of two.</em></span></li>
				<li style="color: #5879ad"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px"><em>His first public performance took place in Hong Kong when he was only 3 years old.</em></span></li>
				<li style="color: #5879ad"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px"><em>He became a professional musician at 18 years old.</em></span></li>
				<li style="color: #5879ad"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px"><em>He was named one of the 50 Greatest Drummers of All Time by Modern Drummer Magazine in 2014.</em></span></li>
