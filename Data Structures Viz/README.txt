A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/MargNation/pen/JEdyob.

This pen will create various data structures from sets of numbers and will allow the user to 
step through each structure and learn how each is created. Hopefully CS students (and others!) 
will benefit from this program.
